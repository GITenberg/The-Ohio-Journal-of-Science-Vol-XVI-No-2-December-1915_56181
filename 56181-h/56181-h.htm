<p>This paper is primarily an attempt to present adequate descriptions
of the types of 30 itonid (cecidomyid) and 2 eriophyid (mite) galls,
collected by the writer on hickory leaves. It is believed to contain
sufficient new material to warrant its publication in advance of a
general survey of N. E. United States zoocecidia, of which it will form
a part. The data is based on collections made in Connecticut, Ohio and
Kansas, most of the material however, being taken in Ohio.</p>

<p>In addition, those forms (few in number) previously described which
have not been seen by the author, have been added, so as to give a
character of completeness to the survey of the two groups of galls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three groups of zoocecidia occurring on hickory trees:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Galls formed by species of Eriophyes (Fam. Eriophyidæ of the Acarina
or mites), or an allied genus. Only two are known.</p>

<p>2. Galls induced by species of Phylloxera (Aphididæ of the Hemiptera).
Pergande<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
has presented an excellent survey of these insects accompanied by very
satisfactory descriptions of the cecidia formed by them.</p>

<p>3. Galls caused by species of Caryomyia (Itonididæ of the Diptera).
Possibly other genera may be represented on the hickories, but
according to Felt<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
“most of the hickory leaf galls are probably made by species of
Caryomyia, though other midges have been reared from these deformities.”</p>
</div>

<p>The genus Caryomyia, which undoubtedly occupies an important place in
relation to the majority of the galls described in the present paper,
will be given special consideration. Felt, to whom American cecidology
is heavily indebted for his extensive studies of dipterous cecidozoons,
presents the following description of the genus Caryomyia in the same
citation as that immediately above.</p>

<p>“Allied to Hormomyia, but differing by the thorax not being greatly
produced over the head and by the presence of but 14 antennal
segments. The males may have the flagellate antennal segments binodose
or cylindric and subsessile and invariably with three low, stout
circumfili. The antennal segments of the female are cylindric and with
two circumfili; palpi tri- or quadri-articulate; wings rather broad,
the third vein joining the costa at or near the wing apex; claws
simple, the pulvilli well developed. The ovipositor of the female is
short and with minute lobes apically. The genus appears to be confined
to hickory leaf galls.”</p>

<p>Adult insects not technically known are given the old generic name
“Cecidomyia.”</p>

<p>These galls as well as similar ones on other kinds of plants arise as
the result of some stimulus (the nature of which is still not definitely
known) applied by the very young larva to the growing tissue of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
immature leaf. Nothing has yet been done on the development of the
itonid galls of the hickories, but from studies on very similar types
we have reason to believe that the ontogeny of the itonid forms is
as follows: The egg is probably deposited superficially (for the
ovipositor of the female Caryomyia is short) on the under side of the
leaflet; on the upper side in a few cases.</p>

<p>Hyperplasia or excessive cell proliferation results (probably not
until after the larva has emerged from the egg) forming at first a
saucer-shaped structure, then cup-shaped and finally by the ingrowth
of the edges, the gall becomes a closed structure enveloping the larva
in a chamber. The distal growth, seldom if ever in the hickory forms,
proceeds so far as to obliterate the opening which was so prominent in
the very immature cup-shape stage. Hence in practically all galls of
this type a minute canal or pore can be demonstrated at the distal end.
In Küster’s<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
very serviceable classification of abnormal plant parts, these fall
under his “umwallungen” cecidia, a term very succinctly describing
their mode of development.</p>

<p>Two of the following described galls have been studied histologically
by Cook,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
<i>Caryomyia holotricha</i> O. S. and <i>C. tubicola</i> O. S.</p>

<p>Concerning the problem of the distribution of the galls on the
different species of hickory, it is still too early to be able to make
any positive assertions. In most of the reports the species of tree has
not been given. It is very well known that certain species of galls are
found on 2 and 3 species of hickory, but whether they are developed on
all indiscriminately is not known. <i>H. cordiformis</i> seems to bear much
fewer species than <i>H. ovata</i> or <i>H. alba</i>. In the present list, the
report of the gall upon a particular species of tree does not at all
imply that it does not occur on others.</p>

<p>Having had the opportunity to give attention to gall collecting
in three rather widely separate localities, eastern Connecticut,
southern and northern Ohio and eastern Kansas, some observations on
the geographical distributions of the hickory itonids are here briefly presented.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>It is sometimes stated that the distribution of gall insects is similar
to that of their host plants. In certain cases this does not seem to
be true. In that of my number 32 first found and described by Sears,
no report of this large and striking form has appeared, showing it
to occur east of the Allegheny mountain system, a region in which
<i>H. ovata</i> is abundant. In the cases of my numbers 5, 9, 19 and 31,
all heretofore unreported and possessing prominent distinguishing
characters, it would seem as though they were somewhat restricted in
their distribution, for while comparatively common in Ohio, they are
never seen in Connecticut or Kansas, where equally intensive collecting
was prosecuted. So few are the students of cecidia and so meager
the data in this field, that it is, however, much too early to make
positive assertions in matters of geographic distribution.</p>

<p>The data on the galls presented herewith was compiled for the most
part at the time of collection; the notes and drawings made from fresh
material. For later comparative work, the material was all preserved in
formalin, each collection being assigned to a vial.</p>

<p>The writer has refrained from attaching a specific name to his new
species of cecidia, a practice very common on the part of European
cecidologists. Even though the adult gall has no direct relation to
the adult insect, the fact, nevertheless, remains that the specificity
of the gall owes its origin to the specificity of the physiological
phenomena of the larval insect, and it is this, which in the mind of
the writer, gives pre-eminence to the insect. The adult gall and the
adult insect can be conceived as arising from the same complex, the
larva, the adult insect bearing, however, a more intimate and direct
relation to the original source of events than the gall. In many cases
the adult insects offer characters, making possible the delimitation of
species, with greater exactness, than do the galls. For these reasons
new names of cecidia should only appear with adequate descriptions of
the cecidozoons.</p>

<p>Though the galls almost uniformly occur on the under side of the
leaflet, the drawings have presented them in an inverted position, with
the gall uppermost, this being the position in which the galls would be
examined. In practically all cases there are two sketches of the type,
one showing the exterior aspect of the gall, the other the interior as
seen in a vertical, median section. The figure number is in all cases
the same as the list number.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer wishes to express his appreciation of the hospitality of
his friend, J. L. King, who, as assistant entomologist for the Ohio
Experiment Station, shared his field laboratory during some of the time
in which cecidological collecting was being carried on.</p>

<p>Though the writer has seen (with a few exceptions) the types herewith
detailed an amply sufficient number of times to establish them as
types, he does not claim infallibility, for the key he has worked
out to these types. It is hoped, however, that it, together with the
descriptions and illustrations will enable the student of the hickory
galls to become better acquainted with the members of the two groups treated.</p>

<p>Britton and Brown’s Illustrated Flora Northern U. S. and Canada, (2nd
edition), New York, 1913, has been followed in the matter of plant nomenclature.</p>

<p>The following two galls whose makers have been named by Felt have
probably not been seen by the writer. Felt’s descriptions are given.
They are not included in the key.</p>

<p class="f90"><b>Caryomyia thompsoni</b> Felt.<br />
<span class="ws4">“Globose, thin-walled, long haired, melon-shaped, dia. 2-3 mm.”</span><br />
<span class="ws4">See my number 23.</span></p>

<p class="f90"><b>Caryomyia antennata</b> Felt.<br />
<span class="ws4">“Globose, thick-walled, yellowish green or brown. Dia. 4-5 mm.”</span></p>

<p>This description, as far as it goes, would indicate a similarity to
C. persicoides Beut.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Key.</span></h3>

<p>The itonid group of galls herewith presented can be distinguished with
one exception (No. 33) from the very common Phylloxera galls (Aphididæ)
by the fact that the latter forms which are sufficiently small to be
comparable in size to the itonids are intercalated in the leaf blade,
i. e. the gall extends more or less prominently from both sides of
the leaf. The itonids always give the appearance of an appendicular
structure attached to the leaf.</p>

point.” Osten Sacken.</p>

<p>This form is so different from the other itonid galls of the hickory
that the writer is inclined to place it here tentatively. It is very
similar to <i>Phylloxera caryævenæ</i> Fitch, with the exception that the
hyperplasia extends below the leaf, while in the phylloxera gall it is
developed on the upper side. The writer has observed orange colored
larvæ in the aphid galls, but they were not definitely determined to be itonid.</p>

<p>Since this type of gall has not since been reported as definitely
caused by itonid larvæ, it is barely possible that Osten Sacken
described the empty phylloxera gall above mentioned containing
inquilinous itonid larvæ. The writer found many of these galls deserted
by the aphids in the middle of July and Pergande states that the aphid
nymphs begin to leave the galls in July. At this time, these galls
are a “pale yellow” color as described for the “cynipsea” gall. The
writer’s observations were made in southern Ohio, while Osten Sacken’s
were made in the vicinity of Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Leaf, under side, double chambered conic or depressed (<a href="#PLATE_I">Fig. 5a</a>) gall.
The latter condition is perhaps the more usual. In these forms, the
conic tip is sunken in the central fovea, the gall only measuring from
1½-2 mm. vertical diameter. The conic forms are as though the tip was
pulled out destroying the fovea. These often measure 5 mm. in height.
The width of the galls varies from 3-5 mm. Very light green, or when
older yellow to red, surface roughened with low tubercles as seen
with lens. Inner chamber sub-conic with short mucronate tip. Walls
of both chambers thin and smooth, outer wall slightly sticky. Base
of gall flat, arising from a definite pedicel, resting in a cup-like
depression, which is formed in a definite hyperplasia intercalated
in the leaf. Above, this hyperplasia is evident as a raised circular
area, 2½ mm. diameter, in the center of which is a minute light colored papilla.</p>

<p>A most interesting variant of this form is illustrated in <a href="#PLATE_II">Fig. 16a</a>.
If it were not for the large number of intermediate forms found, this
one would easily be considered distinct. The region of the chamber
surrounded by thick walls has been much reduced, so that only a
circular area about the upper part of the chamber has the thick wall
projecting from it. This new condition results in the formation of a
definite saucer-shaped structure on the distal end of the gall. In
some specimens the structure was no longer saucer-shape, but by the
ingrowth of the edges it was assuming a spherical form, developing
a two-chambered gall. It is natural to suspect that this may have
been the mode of origin of the four-double-chambered galls described
elsewhere in this paper. That, however, is entirely problematic.</p>

by definite sclerenchyma layer. Cortical tissue firm. Attached by
irregular process from leaf extending into base of gall. In the massed
forms, the galls are similar in structure, but are variously shaped,
due to mutual pressure, (<a href="#PLATE_II">Fig. 21b</a>). Compactly attached to the common

<p>A gall which may eventually prove to be a different species but which
here is provisionally classed as a variety of <i>C. holotricha</i>, was
found in numbers on the leaves of <i>H. alba</i>, though it is probably not
restricted to this species of hickory. Instead of an apical nipple,
it has an apical pit, which is choked with the characteristic brown
pubescence of this type of gall. Internally a tuft of coarse brown
trichomes extends inwardly from the distal side of the chamber. The
chamber occupies the proximal one-half to two-thirds of the gall, the
wall over it being uniformly very thick. This type of gall is constant,
being collected repeatedly and examined minutely.</p>

<p>Based on Felt’s brief description, his <i>Caryomyia thompsoni</i> Felt was
taken from this gall or one very similar to it.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the above variety is another form, with internal
tuft of trichomes, in which the apical nipple is present. The layer
of tissue lining the chamber appears very white, due probably to the
character of the tissue beneath the superficial nutritive layer. In
section the thin white chamber wall is very definitely delimited from
the adjoining darker tissues. Many of these conic-sub-spheric galls
were 6 mm. in width. Collected on <i>H. glabra</i>. Types of this and the
above variety are at the Ohio State University.</p>

<p>Type specimens at Ohio State University.</p>

<p class="no-indent">28. <b>Cecidomyia</b> sp. <b>Cecidium</b> nov.</p>

<p>On leaf, generally upper side, delicate, small, sub-cylindric galls,
standing erect, 2-2½ mm. high, less than 1 mm. wide, constricted
proximally to the slightly flaring base. Distal end marked off by a
circular ridge, in the center of which is a rounded nipple. This latter
turns dark early. Gall light green, at length turning brown. Arises
from intervenal areas between the smaller veins. On the under side of
the leaf the gall above is indicated by a minute dark area. Attached to
leaf by minute central pedicel.</p>

<p>Collected in Hocking County, Ohio, on <i>H. alba</i> in July.</p>

<p>Type specimens at Ohio State University.</p>

<p class="no-indent">29. <b>Cecidozoon</b> (Type undetermined.) <b>Cecidium</b> nov.</p>

<p>On leaf, under side, rather large, pouch-like gall (5-6 mm. long)
arising from a principal vein. Shaped like a stout gourd, it is bent
over nearly recumbent against the blade of the leaf. 2-2½ mm. wide. The
proximal end is sharply constricted at the minute point of attachment.
The walls when collected were light brown in color, sparsely covered
with short white hairs. Walls very thin and when dry brittle. Interior
surface smooth. Inconspicuous on the upper side of the leaf, except for
the minute pore next the vein. Two specimens from the same leaflet.</p>

<p>This gall differs so markedly from all the other cecidomyidous galls
of the hickories, that I am not certain just where to place it. They
contained no occupants of any kind.</p>

<p>Collected in Hocking County, Ohio, on <i>H. glabra</i>, July.</p>

<p>Type specimens at Ohio State University.</p>

<p class="no-indent">30. <b>Cecidomyia</b> sp. <b>Cecidium</b> nov.</p>

<p>On leaf, under side, obconic gall resting in firm collar-like base.
Somewhat similar to 31, but differs in definite constant characters to
make it distinct. Proximal end not rounded but definitely conic, distal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
broad end with prominent fovea in the center of which arises a well
defined nipple. Dia. across top, 2½ mm., height from leaf surface, 2
mm. Greenish to reddish brown, smooth. No prominence or convexity of
leaf surface opposite the gall, a slight discoloration only marking the
position of the cecidium.</p>

<p>Collected in Hocking County, Ohio, on <i>H. microcarpa</i>, July.</p>

<p>Type specimens at Ohio State University.</p>

<p class="no-indent">31. <b>Cecidomyia</b> sp. <b>Cecidium</b> nov.</p>

<p>On leaf, under side, small, obconic galls which in development appear
to burst through the epidermis, for gall is surrounded by the ragged
collar-like remnant. The rounded proximal end strongly sunken in the
leaf blade which is prominently convex on the opposite side. Distal
end truncate with funnel-like depression leading to the rather large
apical pore. This latter connects the depressed chamber within with the
exterior. Distal broad end 1½ mm. wide. Gall projects from leaf surface
1-1½ mm. Smooth; light greenish-yellow in color. Walls very thick
distally, very thin proximally where it is connected to the leaf at
the central region. On the upper side of the leaf the low, hemispheric
convexity is reddened, particularly toward the periphery. At first it
was thought that this gall might be a juvenile form of <i>H. tubicola</i>,
but later observations have shown it to grow no further in length. It
is without doubt distinct and new.</p>

<p class="no-indent">32. <b>Cecidomyia</b> sp.</p>

<p>“Leaf-gall on under surface, having the form of a much depressed
inverted cone, attached by its apex, and with the free base surrounded
by a conspicuous fringe. 3-4 mm. high, 4-5 mm. in diameter. Green to
light yellow-green. Huron, July 25. Quite rare and I believe hitherto
unreported.” Sears.</p>

<p>The author has collected this interesting gall at Gypsum, Ohio, in
August. Many of them measured 5 mm., not including the radiate,
bract-like processes borne on the flaring rim of the gall. The galls
bear an evanescent thin disk of tissue on the distal, central region,
which is clear brown in color and bears erect scattered trichomes. The
underlying surface of the gall or the outer convex part is perfectly
smooth. The origin of the apical, brown disk is problematical; from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
material at hand it appeared as if the rim of the gall had developed by
pushing out beneath the original apical tissue. After the disk falls,
only a minute dark spot marks the apex of the gall. The surface of the
under half of the gall, below the flaring, lacerate rim, is more or
less pubescent.</p>

<p>Chamber comparatively large; walls thin.</p>

<p>This very striking gall has thus far only been collected by Mr. Sears
and myself, both times in northern Ohio and occurring on <i>H. ovata</i>.</p>

<p>Some specimens, all occurring on the same leaf varied in that they were
not so depressed (almost sub-hemispheric) and had the rim strongly
inturned against the very convex distal half of the gall.</p>

<p><small>Sears, Ohio Nat. 15:380. 1914.</small></p>

<p class="no-indent">33. <b>Cecidomyia?</b> sp.</p>

<p>On leaf, blister-like, irregularly circular in outline, 2½-3½ mm.
diameter, ½ mm. thick. Extends above and below about equally. Sometimes
a slight central nipple is formed below. Greenish to brownish with
discolored margin.</p>

<p>Collected in Vinton County, Ohio, on <i>H. cordiformis</i>.</p>

<p>Probably same as Felt’s “Leaf blister gall, irregular, dull greenish or
black margined with small nipple. Diameter 3mm.”</p>

<p>This type of gall is so different from all the other cecidomyid forms
that it is doubtful if it is a member of that group. It may possibly
be an immature or small Phylloxera gall. The writer found white larvæ
within his specimens, but was unable to determine them as cecidomyid
larvæ. This gall is thus introduced here, provisionally.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2>THE GEOMETRY OF THE<br /> TRANSLATED NORMAL CURVE.</h2></div>

<p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Carl J. West</span>, Ph. D.</p>

<p><b>Introduction.</b> In curve tracing the graphic representation is
constructed from the equation. Due largely to the requirements of
statistics the converse, namely, to find the equation of the curve
when the distribution of points is given, has become of interest. This
problem is very different from the exercises of analytical geometry
in which a given law of distribution of points is to be translated
into algebraic language. For the presence in the statistical data of
accidental irregularities makes it undesirable as well as practically
impossible to obtain a curve passing <i>through</i> the points. Instead, a
curve is “fitted” to the points, that is, a curve is passed <i>among</i> the
points in accordance with some generally accepted principal such as
that of least squares or the agreement of moments.</p>

<p>Aside from the straight line and the parabolas, the curves proposed
by Pearson<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
have found acceptance. In order to derive curves which
can be fitted to widely varying distributions of points, Professor F.
Y. Edgeworth<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
has proposed to modify, to <i>translate</i>, the normal
probability curve with unit standard deviation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation01.jpg" alt="_" width="100" height="43" />
</div>

<p>In this article we shall discuss the geometry of the curves which
Edgeworth obtains by this transformation and derive a method for an
approximate solution of the two equations, one of the fourth and the
other of the sixth degree, which arise in the fitting of a curve of
this class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that the final curve may be written in terms of the
co-ordinates x and y the equation of the base or generating normal
probability curve is written:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation02.jpg" alt="_" width="100" height="38" />
</div>

<p class="no-indent">where t denotes abscissas and z ordinates.</p>

<p>Let the abscissas of the transformed curve be functions of the
corresponding abscissas of the base curve. Then it may be assumed that
x can be developed in powers of t, and hence we may write on omitting
fourth and higher powers,</p>

<p class="center"><big>x = a(t + κt<sup>2</sup> + λt<sup>3</sup>),</big></p>

<p class="no-indent">where a, κ and λ are constants to be determined in “fitting” the curve.</p>

<p>Since x denotes the value of a measurement and y the frequency of x,
that is, the number of individuals possessing that value of x, the
magnitude of an element of area denotes the number of individuals
between two values of x. Obviously, therefore, if the transformation is
to be of concrete value the magnitude of an element of area must not be
altered, though of course the shape will be changed. Hence</p>

<p><span class="ws4"><big>y dx = z dt</big>,</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="ws4"><big>y = z dt/dx</big></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation03.jpg" alt="_" width="225" height="47" />
</div>

<p>The formulas of transformation are thus:</p>

<p class="center space-below1"><big>x = a(t + κt<sup>2</sup> + λt<sup>3</sup>),</big></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation04.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="53" />
</div>

<p><b>Maximum and Minimum Points.</b> Since only curves with one maximum
point or mode are practically useful it is desirable to determine what
values of the constants a, κ and λ give unimodal curves.</p>

<p>We have</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation05.jpg" alt="_" width="450" height="118" />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>From the vanishing of the numerator of dy/dx there must result either
one or three real modes for each pair of values for λ and κ, that is,
for each translated curve. To determine what values of λ and κ give
uni-modal curves and what tri-modal it is convenient to consider the
plane of λ and κ.</p>

<p>The discriminant of the equation</p>

<p class="center"><big>3λt<sup>3</sup> + 2κt<sup>2</sup> + (1 + 6λ)t + 2κ = 0</big></p>
<p class="no-indent">is</p>
<p class="center"><big>16κ<sup>4</sup> - κ<sup>2</sup>(1 + 66λ + 117λ<sup>2</sup>) + 3λ(1 + 6λ)<sup>3</sup> = 0</big></p>

<p> This fourth degree curve crosses the horizontal or λ-axis at λ = 0
and at λ = -⅙ and when λ = 0 its equation reduces to 16κ^4 - κ^2 = 0 or
κ = ±0, κ = ±¼. There is thus contact with the vertical or κ-axis at
the origin and that axis is crossed at the points (0, ±¼). At the point
(λ = -⅙, κ = 0) there is a cusp with the λ-axis for tangent. The other
two intersections with the line λ = -⅙ are imaginary, indicating the
presence of two branches to the curve.</p>

<p>The discriminant of the denominator of dy/dx is the parabola (in λ and κ),</p>

<p class="center"><big>κ<sup>2</sup> - 3λ = 0</big></p>

<p>The evident close geometrical connection between the two discriminants
suggests arranging the discriminant of the cubic curve in the following form:</p>

<p class="center"><big>(κ<sup>2</sup> - 3λ) (16κ<sup>2</sup> - 117λ<sup>2</sup> - 18λ - 1) - 27λ<sup>3</sup>(1 - 24λ) = 0</big></p>

<p>From the equation in this, the well known uv +
kws = 0 form, numerous elementary geometrical facts
can be derived. The relations to the hyperbola,
<big>16κ<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;117λ<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;18λ&nbsp;-&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,</big>
and to the parabola, <big>κ<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;3λ&nbsp;=&nbsp;0</big>, premit
of the ready plotting of the curve with sufficient accuracy. The
general shape of the curve is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that one branch of the curve is within the parabola,
almost coinciding with it, while the other crosses it at λ = 1/24. From
the original form of this equation it appears that the two branches
of this discriminant meet just inside the parabola in the end points
with approximate co-ordinates (0.043, ±0.360). The geometry of the cusp
and end-points on the discriminant curve is suggestive of interesting
development in detail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Values of λ and κ for points on the discriminant give curves with two
modes coinciding. All points on one side of the discriminant have three
real and distinct modes, and all on the other have one real and two
imaginary modes. To determine on which side the points giving three
real modes lie we examine a point inside the discriminant. When κ = 0
the modal equation becomes</p>

<p class="center"><big>3λt<sup>3</sup> + (1 + 6λ)t = 0</big>.</p>

<p>Hence the roots are</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <p class="center">t = 0&emsp;and</p>
    <img src="images/equation06.jpg" alt="_" width="150" height="54" />
</div>

<p>The quantity under the radical is positive for values of λ between 0 and-⅙.
Therefore, all points within the discriminant curve yield
tri-modal curves and all without uni-modal curves.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="FIG_I" id="FIG_I"></a>
    <p class="f200"><i>The plane of λ and κ</i></p>

    <p class="f150"><i>Fig. I</i></p>
    <p class="center space-below2">(<i>The horizontal scale is twice the vertical scale</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The infinite values of dy/dx arise from zero values of the quadratic,
<big>1 + 2κt + 3λt<sup>2</sup></big>. The greatest possible number of modes for
any one curve is therefore five, three from the cubic and two from
the quadratic. Since for infinite values of dy/dx the corresponding
ordinates are infinite, it is advisable to study the location of the
infinite points of the curve, rather to the neglect of the idea of
maximum values at such points.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Infinite Ordinates.</b> The infinite points on a curve are given by
the values of t satisfying the equation</p>

<p class="center"><big>3λt<sup>2</sup> + 2κt + 1 = 0</big>.</p>

<p>Except under certain limited conditions to be determined later a curve
with infinite ordinates can not be of great statistical value.</p>

<p>The parabola, <big>κ<sup>2</sup>-3λ = 0</big>, obtained by equating the discriminant of
this quadratic to zero separates the points on the (λ, κ) plane which
correspond to curves of <i>no</i> infinite points from those corresponding
to curves of <i>two</i> infinite points.</p>

<p>Therefore, all pairs of values of λ and κ within the parabola, with the
exception of the very narrow region also within the first discriminant
curve, give uni-modal curves without infinite ordinates.</p>

<p><b>Types of Curves.</b> Without entering into detailed proofs we will
now investigate the general shape of the curves corresponding to values
of λ and κ in each of the distinct regions of the plane of λ and κ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>In the region beneath the parabola and to the right from the shaded
area of <a href="#FIG_I">Fig. I</a> the curve is essentially of the shape
shown in <a href="#FIG_II">Fig. II</a>. This type includes
the most common skew curves and hence is of great importance in statistics.</p>

<p>As the point (λ, κ) moves from the λ-axis the crest rises until
the parabola is reached when the infinite ordinates appear as two
coincident lines, shown in <a href="#FIG_II">Fig. III</a>.</p>

<p>After the parabola is passed, the infinite ordinates separate and the
curve apparently separates into three branches as in <a href="#FIG_II">Fig. IV</a>.</p>

<p>In crossing the κ-axis to the left one asymptote moves off to infinity
giving a curve of the type shown in <a href="#FIG_II">Fig. V</a>.</p>

<p>Then the asymptote reappears giving a curve of the type shown in <a href="#FIG_II">Fig. VI</a>.</p>

<p>This general shape is preserved as the point moves toward the λ-axis
and when the point reaches the discriminant curve the middle branch is
flattened at the minimum point.</p>

<p>For points within the discriminant curve two minimum points appear and
the central branch now shows a maximum with a minimum point on either
side as in <a href="#FIG_II">Fig. VII</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Tri-modal Curves.</b> The curves corresponding to values of (λ,
κ) within the discriminant, because of the requirement that an element
of area under the translated curve must always be equivalent to the
corresponding element under the base or generating curve, can be of
statistical value only under the following conditions.</p>

<p>The area between the two ordinates corresponding to t = ±3 is 0.99998
of the total area under the curve, so that when neither of the minimum
points corresponds to points closer than three units to the origin
of the base curve the curve may be practically valuable. A moment’s
consideration will show that the abscissas of the two minimum points
must be practically the same as that of the corresponding infinite
ordinates. The roots of the quadratic</p>

<p class="center"><big>3λt<sup>2</sup> + 2κt + 1 = 0</big></p>

<p>are numerically greater than 3 for all pairs of values of (λ, κ) lying
above the line</p>

<p class="center"><big>27λ - 6κ + 1 = 0</big></p>

<p>As statistically promising within the discriminant of the cubic we then
have the shaded area of the (λ, κ) plane.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Origin.</b> The generating curve is the symmetrical normal
probability curve with origin at its center. Since x = 0 when t = 0,
the origin of the translated curve coincides with that of the base or
generating curve. The translated curve may not be symmetrical so that
the mean ordinate may not coincide with the modal ordinate. Because of
the relation between corresponding areas the ordinate at the origin
must continue to divide the area under the curve into equal parts, that
is, the origin and median always coincide.</p>

<p><b>Determination of the Constants.</b> Since the exact position of
the median can not ordinarily be determined by inspection or direct
computation there are in reality four constants to be determined: the
distance between the median and the mean, a, κ and λ.</p>

<p>In determining the constants it is usual to compute the value of the
first four moments. The third and fourth moments are extensions of
the idea of the well known formulas for the first and second moments.
Denoting the moments about the median by μ, we have</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation07.jpg" alt="_" width="200" height="214" />
</div>

<p class="no-indent">where N is the total area under the curve.</p>

<p>The values of the μ’s are computed from the data<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and equated to the corresponding integrals which of course involve the
four constants. In this way four equations are obtained from which the
values of the constants may be determined. Since it is our present
object to discuss the solution only of these equations, merely the
principal results will be given.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The general form for the moments about the median of the
area under the translated curve is</p>

<p>On applying the two well known formulas:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/equation09.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="121" />
</div>

<p class="no-indent">the determination of μ<sub>1</sub>´, μ<sub>2</sub>´, μ<sub>3</sub>´ and μ<sub>4</sub>´ is reduced
to a matter of algebraic detail. Then on transferring to the arithmetic mean as
origin the values of μ<sub>2</sub>, μ<sub>3</sub>, and μ<sub>4</sub> can be determined in terms
of a, κ and λ. It is most convenient however, to make use of the
quantities β<sub>1</sub> = μ<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> &frasl; μ<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup> and β<sub>2</sub> = μ<sub>4</sub> &frasl; μ<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> or rather β = β<sub>1</sub> &frasl; 8
and ϵ&nbsp;=&nbsp;(β<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;3) &frasl; 12 and express the constants in terms of these
quantities. It is to be noted that both ϵ and β are zero for a normal
distribution, that is, for λ = κ = 0.</p>

<p>Omitting the detailed reduction<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which is straightforward and direct,
we have</p>

<p>Obviously no algebraic solution can be obtained from equations (3) and
(4) for κ and λ in terms of the computed values β and ϵ, and hence a
resort to tables is necessary. The values of β and ϵ for values of κ
from 0 to 0.0335 and of λ from -0.040 to +0.100 have been computed.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The process of determining the constants of the translated normal curve
consists first in computing β and ϵ from the given data, and then in
entering the table and interpolating for the corresponding values of
κ and λ.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
On substituting these values in (2) the value of a can be found
and thence on multiplying a by κ the position of the median of the
distribution is obtained.</p>

<p>The sign of κ is determined by the sign of the third moment about the
mean μ<sub>3</sub>, that is, by the direction of the skewness or asymmetry. For
positive skewness the mean must lie to the right of the median and
hence μ<sub>1</sub>´, the first moment about the mean, must be positive which
necessitates a positive sign for κ. Therefore, the sign of κ is the
same as that of the skewness.</p>

<p>To fit a curve to the given data, after the constants have been
determined it is necessary to find, by solving a cubic equation for
each value, the values of t corresponding to the x’s of the respective
classes. The cubic is</p>

<p class="center"><big>aλt<sup>3</sup> + aκt<sup>2</sup> + at - x = 0</big>.</p>

<p>Any of the various methods of approximating to the solution of a cubic
may be used in solving these equations.</p>

<p>The area of each class can now be obtained by computing the
corresponding areas under the standard normal curve from a table of the
probability integral.</p>

<p><b>The Method of Interpolation.</b> The actual fitting of the curve can
now be readily accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The distinctively geometrical operation is the interpolation for the
values of λ and κ for a given pair of values of β and ϵ.</p>

<p>Within the limits of the table<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
the curves resulting from the assignment of a constant value to β are practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
straight lines, β&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 is the λ-axis; β = 1 is a line parallel
to the λ-axis. Hence we may safely assume that the variation from one
column to the next and from one line to the next is linear for values
of β. That is, ordinary first difference interpolation methods are applicable.</p>

<p>As regards the system of ϵ curves we have for instance ϵ = .128 at (λ
= .050, κ = 0); again, at approximately (.045, .060) and (.40, .085).
We are therefore warranted in assuming the applicability of first
difference methods to interpolation between the ϵ curves.</p>

<p>As an illustration let us find the values of λ and κ for ϵ = 0.112 and
β = 0.044. On inspection of the table it is seen that λ lies between
0.30 and .035 and κ between .090 and .095. When κ = .090, λ = .033 for
ϵ = .112. When κ = .095, λ = .031 for ϵ = .112. For β = .042 and
κ&nbsp;=&nbsp;.090, λ = .033 and for β = .046 and κ = .095, λ = .031, ϵ = .112 in
each case. Hence, to first differences, λ = .032 and κ = .093 for
ϵ&nbsp;=&nbsp;.112 and β = .044. For interpolation in parts of the table showing
more rapid variations appropriate methods will suggest themselves.</p>

<p>Taken geometrically the table represents two distinct systems of
curves, with each curve of one system intersecting all the curves of
the other system. Therefore, a pair of values for λ and κ can always be
found for values of ϵ and β within the range of the table.</p>

<p>The following preliminary list of the Jassoidae of Missouri is mainly
the result of collections and notes made by the authors during the
summer months of 1915. On account of the lack of records for this
state the authors were prompted to undertake such a survey. As far
as possible collections were made so as to embrace all conditions in
different sections, giving some attention to ecological relations. The
list comprises some 98 species.</p>

<p>The Twenty-fifth Annual Meeting of the Ohio Academy of Science was held
at the Ohio State University, at Columbus, on November 26th and 27th.
A special program was given in commemoration of the Quarter Centennial
Anniversary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science will hold
its Annual Meeting on the Ohio State University Campus, at Columbus,
December 27th, 1915 to January 1st, 1916. A large attendance is
expected and arrangements have been completed to make the meeting one
of unusual interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the November meeting of the Biological Club, the following officers
were elected for the ensuing year: President, Dr. F. H. Krecker of the
Department of Zoology and Entomology; Vice President, Miss Clara G.
Mark, of the Department of Geology; Secretary and Treasurer, Mr. Rollo
C. Baker, of the Department of Anatomy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following officers were named by the Ohio State University
Scientific Society for the year: President, F. C. Blake, Department
of Physics; Vice President, Jas. R. Withrow, Department of Chemistry;
Secretary, R. J. Seymour, Department of Physiology; Treasurer, C. J.
West, Department of Mathematics. These officers constitute an executive
committee which will arrange programs for the regular meetings of the
society, the first of which will occur during January.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An interesting event occurring during the recent meeting of the Ohio
Academy of Science was the short talk given by Dr. T. C. Mendenhall
to the New York and San Francisco alumni of the Ohio State University
by means of the trans-continental telephone. Dr. Mendenhall, while
a member of the University faculty, established the first telephone
to be used in central Ohio, a line from his University office to
his residence, and he expressed himself as greatly pleased at the
opportunity accorded him to speak to his former students over a line
extending across the continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ohio Academy of Science at its November meeting voted to change
the date of its annual session to a time corresponding to the Easter
recess. The exact time of the meeting is to be determined by the
executive committee, the Academy voting to have the next meeting occur
in the spring of 1916.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Established last Spring, the latest honorary society, Phi Sigma, a
student organization open only to students having completed an amount
of biological work equivalent to a minor, has awakened interest in the
universities of other states. Inquiries concerning the possibility of
establishing other chapters at distant institutions have been received
by the parent chapter at Ohio State University and it is probable that
such chapters will be formed during the present year. Phi Sigma hopes
to publish a biological quarterly in the near future.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
